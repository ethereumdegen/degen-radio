- Added `degen-radio radio list --json` and `degen-radio radio play URL` for desktop integrations.
- Restored the Spotatui-style radio page with a persistent directory search box, saved-station and result panels, mouse focus, and left/right panel navigation.
- Added persistent favorite and unfavorite actions from either station panel.
- Added an `x` settings menu with six bundled Omarchy-inspired theme presets: Tokyo Night, Catppuccin, Osaka Jade, Gruvbox, Nord, and Rose Pine.
- Added the current ICY song title to the bottom status box.
- Made the bottom now-playing bar clickable for play/pause and added a live animated equalizer.
- Retuned volume to a square-law perceptual curve so the middle of the slider remains comfortably audible.
